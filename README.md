# Skill Gap Analyzer

This tool compares a resume with a job description to find:

- which skills match
- which skills are missing
- what skills should be learned next

## Goal (MVP)

Use simple text comparison (Python + Pandas) to identify skill gaps
between candidate resume and job posting.

## Future upgrades

- PDF resume reading
- Streamlit UI
- LLM skill explanation
- auto recommended learning roadmap
